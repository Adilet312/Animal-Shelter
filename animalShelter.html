      <p class="about">Roseanne here! Once you get to know me I'm a friendly and gentle girl, just a little bit chatty if you must know the truth. I have super soft fur, love to be petted, and also love treats - but not too many or I'll get fat (they made me say that.) Alert and curious, yet relaxed, I have all the best feline qualities and will make a sweet and loving companion. A fairly calm household would allow my personality to really blossom. Do I sound perfect for you? Please come down and ask for Roseanne!</p>

      <h2>Pearl</h2>

      <p class="about">**Important Note** You won't find this kitty at the shelter. This kitty is waiting patiently in foster care for your call. Please contact the Foster Care Hotline at 206-684-0685 to arrange a meeting. Thank you! "I'm Pearl and I want to be your one and only. I don't mind other adult humans (more neck scratches), but no mini-you or dogs please. My previous owners misunderstood me, so it's taking me a bit of time to trust again. I will give you warnings if you're crossing the line, but if we all keep to some simple rules I'll be happily leaning against you soon. Then comes the purring, the headbutts and my endearing small meow, (which tells you I'm either hungry or to scratch around my neck where my too-tight collar used to be). I can be particular about my litter box, but as long as it's cleaned regularly I'm content. I may have gained some weight when I was overfed at my last home but I'm already looking healthier... though I'm convinced these humans are holding out on me and I could be fed more."Pearl is a beautiful, grey Tabby; warm and eager for love once she feels safe. She enjoys energetically playing with a laser light and while she doesn't really eat catnip, she will happily roll in it. She's not a big fan of anyone trying to pick her up, and won't head for your lap right away, but likes to sprawl within petting distance and purr. She would flourish in a calm, stable, cat-savvy home with no kids or dogs. We're still figuring out how she deals with other cats. She will also need someone who can measure her food to help her continue to lose weight, stay healthy and live a long, happy life. Pearl has a lot of love to give for the right person/people who can be patient with her and earn her trust in a new environment. She is currently residing in the U-District area awaiting a visit.</p>

      <h2>Nubs</h2>

      <p class="about">*Nubs's adoption fee is paid for by the Seattle Animal Shelter Foundation!*Nubs is a laid-back and cool gentleman most of the time, but he likes to be talkative when he wants to play. He likes to curl up like a spoon in his bed in the same room with you when you are watching TV or reading. He rubs his head against your hand, and he likes his neck and ears scratched. In no time he starts to make this hearty, deep purr to let you know how comfortable he is. You know he appreciates you when he wanders around the house and then eventually comes back to you and rubs his head against your legs. When he looks straight into your eyes, and you might think you are looking into the eyes of a wise old man. He often stays low instead of jumping up and down like the younger cats because of his arthritis in the back legs, for which he needs to take 0.25ml gabapentin via his mouth twice a day for pain relief. But he is super easy to dose. Because of the pain in his knees, he wobbles a little when he walks. He doesn't move around a lot, instead he enjoys sleeping most of the day. He is a manx with just a nub of a tail (hence Nubs), and a very handsome cat. He is not picky about food, dry or wet. Nubs will be the best companion you could ask for!</p>

      <h2>Summy</h2>
      <img src="https://dl5zpyw5k3jeb.cloudfront.net/photos/pets/46241440/1/?bust=1571227899&width=1080" alt="Summy">
      <p class="about">Sammy is two armfuls of bright ginger fur and a big heart! Though shy with strangers, once he becomes comfortable he is a sweet, friendly and affectionate fellow who enjoys being petted and brushed. His happy purr can't help but make you feel happy too. Sammy has a rotund figure and will need a sensible weight loss plan in the future to stay healthy. He came to the shelter with his pal, Sasha (see her separate profile), and they could be adopted together as a ready-made compatible pair. If cheerful Sammy (and maybe beautiful Sasha, too) sounds like your kinda cat(s), what are you waiting for?</p>
